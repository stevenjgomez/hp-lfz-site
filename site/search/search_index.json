Each laser emits a wavelength of 1070 nm and is capable of reaching 200 W of highly collimated infrared light. This totals a whopping 1400 W of laser power, and just a few milliWatts can start a fire. The light is invisible, and thus can be incredibly dangerous. It is important to prioritize laser safety when working with these furnaces. Some quick do's and don'ts: Danger Do not bend the fiber optic cable, it is very fragile and has a minimum curvature that it can withstand. Do not allow any dust or dirt to obstruct the output of the laser optics. These particles can burn or melt the optics themselves. Laser safety There are several key components of laser safety in the Laser Lab. Firstly, the optics should always keep the beam in an enclosed space, such that minimal free laser light is able to leave the lens tubes and/or chamber. Secondly, the laser curtains should always be ( closed ) when the lasers are armed to emit any infrared light. This is evidenced by the green \"Start\" button being illuminated on the front housing of each laser unit. This does not necessarily mean they are emitting any infrared light - emission is indicated by the large orange LED bar on the front of each laser unit. Similarly, whenever the laser units are armed, occupants of the lab should be wearing laser safety goggles with optical density (OD) 6+ at 1070 nm. These are not strictly required when the laser curtains are closed but should certainly be worn at all times when the curtain is open and the lasers are armed (regardless of whether emission is on). Using the Laser Controller Software Starting the software Make sure all the laser units are turned on. Click the \"LOKII Laser Controller Project\" given by the following icon. The software should open and prompt for the creating of a logfile. If the logfile prompt does not pop up, this means that the software is not communicating correctly with the lasers and must be restarted. For testing / growth setup, a dummy logfile \"test.txt\" can be used. For a logged growth, create a new logfile following the naming convention of previous files to keep files organized. Example filename: \"20230515_Log100_Sr2IrO4_growth50.txt\" Basic LabVIEW working principles The LabVIEW software is built to run in a continunous while loop, which only stops when the large red button is pressed. The current step is indicated by the Step text box indicator on the top of the Laser Controller. While understanding the function of each step in the while loop is not important for the general user, the details can be found in a later section. The important thing to understand is that your actions in LabVIEW are not put into effect until the loop has completed the next full cycle . This results is some delays between, for example, when you click the Aiming Beam button and when the aiming beam actually turns on. Enabling communication with the lasers On the left hand side of the Laser Controller, there are 7 buttons enabling communication with each of the laser units, shown here: In the picture above, all lasers will receive commands as indicated by the illuminated green light on each button. When sending commands to a select few lasers, simply disable the corresponding button in this section. Using the aiming beam (visible red light) For sample alignment, beam alignment, and beam focusing, the lasers offer a visible red laser light source called the \"aiming beam\". This radiation is visible, and is relatively low power. While delivering lower power than the infrared light, direct eye contact with the aiming beam can still cause injury. To enable the aiming beam, click the Aiming Beam button on the Laser Controller. Using the infrared beam (1070 nm light) For delivering heating power to a sample, use the infrared beam, which has a wavelength of 1070 nm and a maximum power output of 200 W. There are several steps to using the infrared beam. Press the green Start button on the front of each laser unit to arm the lasers for emission. You will hear the cooling fans spin up on each unit. This does not mean laser light is being emitted at this point, but laser goggles and curtains should be used at all times when the lasers are in this state (see Laser Safety ). Ensure that the proper filtering optics are in place: Notch filter (1064 nm) in front of the pyrometer Short pass filter in front of the camera If needed, a neutral density filter (options: ND1, ND2, ND4) to dim the image in front of the camera as well. Click Emission On . You should see the orange LED bar on the front of each laser unit flash three times and stay illuminated. This means that the infrared beam is emitting light - be cautious. Setting the laser output power Three tabs Set Power, Ramp Power, and Set Pulsing in the center of the laser controller are used as inputs to control the laser output power. Manually set a power Using the Set Power tab, enter a power in the Power (W) input field, and press the Set Power button to set the power. Warning This only sets the power for the lasers for which Laser Communication is enabled. The power setpoint for the other lasers will remain unmodified in this case. Automatic power ramping Using the Ramp Power tab, enter the desired power setpoint in the Target Power (W) field and a ramp rate (1 W/min is a safe value to start) in the Ramp Rate (W/min) field. Click Calculate Ramp to set the values and calculate a Ramp Time (min) displayed in the top right. With Emission on/off set to on, click Ramp! to begin ramping the power to the desired setpoint. The graph below shows the average output power among the seven lasers. The green Ramping indicator under the Ramp Time (min) indicator illuminates to bright green. To stop the ramp, click the small STOP button to the right of the Ramping indicator. This pauses the ramp at the current setpoint. Optionally, you may change the target power or the ramp rate when the ramp is stopped - to do so, simply enter new values and click the Calculate Ramp button to save these changes. To resume the ramp, click the Ramp! button. Once the setpoint reaches the target power, the ramp will stop automatically. Laser pulsing The laser units are equipped with an internal pulsing control which allows the beam to pulse at a chosen frequency with chosen pulse width. These are set using the Set Pulsing tab. Set a desired pulse width in ms by entering a value in the Pulse Width (ms) field and click Set Pulse Width . The default pulse frequency or Pulse Repetition Rate (Hz) as labeled in the Laser Controller software is 100 Hz - meaning that 100 pulses occur per second, equivalent to one pulse every 10 ms. The duty cycle is then controlled exclusively by the pulse width, meaning that a pulse with of 5 ms corresponds to a duty cycle = 50% as shown below. In the default configuration, the duty cycle can be calculated using the forumla \\(\\rm{Duty} = \\rm{Width}/10~\\rm{ms} \\times 100\\%\\) . The pulsing mode indicators can be found towards the left side of the Laser Controller. These indicators glow orange when pulsing is enabled.

Computer 1 is mainly used for imaging, and Computer 2 is mainly used for controlling the lasers. These computers should usually be left on, and require occasional restarts. Both are remotely accessible via Google Remote Desktop on the wilsonlabucsb Google account. Lasers The seven laser units live in the server rack next to the furnace. In their \"off\" state, the key on the front of each unit is vertical. Turn each unit on by turning each of the seven keys clockwise. Lasers are numbered 1-7, with numbers that correspond to each of the windows on the furnace chamber. Laser Controller Software Each laser unit has a touchscreen that allows for full control of the laser, though we rarely use this feature and mainly control the lasers from Computer 2 using a custom Laser Controller Software built in LabVIEW. Start the software by clicking the LOKII logo (green heptagon), labled \"LOKII Laser Controller Project\". Note The software should prompt for the creation of a logfile. Otherwise, the program is not communicating correctly with the lasers and must be restarted. When doing preparation steps, feel free to save a \"dummy\" logfile, usually called \"test.txt\". Translators The translator control unit is located on the server rack, above the seven laser units. The translators are then controlled using a touchscreen monitor located to the right of Computer 2. Turn the translator unit on by flipping the red switch on the top right of the translator unit. The touchscreen monitor on the computer desk should begin turning on - if not, ensure that the monitor itself is powered on. Pyrometer The pyrometer is a remote-sensing thermometer that measures the temperature of the molten zone on the basis of its thermal radiation spectrum. The pyrometer is controlled via software on Computer 1 called \"DataTemp MultiDrop\". The pyrometer is located on Window 4 . Open DataTemp MultiDrop software. Open an \"Application Configuration\", which loads the correct ethernet configuration as well as the previously used arrangement of data readout windows and data graphs used on the desktop. The temperature reading can be performed using 1-color or 2-color modes: Monochrome models (1-color) for standard temperature measurement applications The 1-color mode is best for measuring the temperature of targets in areas where no sighting obstructions, either solid or gaseous, exist. Such 1-color mode is also best where the target completely fills the measurement spot. Ratio models (2-color) for specific temperature measurement applications Ratio pyrometers determine the object temperature by the ratio of two separate and overlapping infrared bands. The 2-color mode is best for measuring the temperature of targets that are partially obscured, either intermittently or permanently by other objects, openings, screens, or viewing windows that reduce energy, and by dirt, smoke, or steam in the atmosphere. The 2-color mode can also be used on targets that do not completely fill the measurement spot, provided the background is much cooler than the target. Ratio pyrometers can measure and determine the object temperature in either one of both modes (1-color / 2-color), in which always 2 infrared detectors are active. See the manual from Fluke Process Instruments for more details. Camera The camera is controlled by software on Computer 1 called \"Pylon Viewer\". Open \"Pylon Viewer\" Open Window > Devices > Baseler acA1300. Click the \"Continuous Shot\" button to enable video feed. Note The camera image is significantly darker than the pyrometer image when the furnace is not actively running. Open Window > Features - All > Acquisition Controls > Exposure Time. Use large values (100,000 ms) for setup and lower values (1,000 - 10,000 ms) during growth. Note The frame rate will suffer greatly at high exposure times. It is recommended to use no higher than 100,000 ms, else the image will be \"choppy\". If the frame rate drops to 0 frames per second (fps), simply press \"Stop\" and \"Continuous Shot\" to restart video acquisition. Mass Flow Controller The mass flow controller is controlled by two different programs on Computer 2 , called FlowDDE and FlowPlot . Open FlowDDE and click Communication > Open communication. Open FlowPlot and click \"Start\". Use the \"Select setpoint (%)\" menu to set a flowrate. 100% corresponds to 10 standard liters per minute (SLM) of Ar flow. For other gases, there is a conversion factor calculator available on the Bronkhorst website . Thermocouples The thermocouples are read using a thermocouple reader box which is connected to Computer 2 via USB connection. Open DP1001AM and click Setting > Port and set to COM6 (subject to change). Click \"Connect\" and all three thermocouples should provide a reading. Each reading corresponds to a region of the chamber as follows: Channel 1: Window 6 Channel 2: Window 3 Channel 3: Window 1 These ports are all at different distances from the central chamber bore as specified in the chamber drawings . Pressure Gauge Viewer The pressure gauge at the outlet is monitored by a Logitech Webcam connected to Computer 2 . Open Logitech Software to view the camera. Physically adjust the webcam to capture at least the range 0 psi to 10,000 psi. Growth Logs Open the Growth Logs folder on Google Drive. Copy an existing log and maintain the naming scheme to keep files organized. See existing logs for examples - keep a good record of growth details. Images can also be included.

Powder synthesis Typically powders are dried for at least 6 hours before this step. Grind powder using mortar and pestle or ball milling techniques until fine. Consider using a sieve to achieve uniformly fine powder. Warning If powder carries moisture or is coarse, it will likely not press as easily. Packing a rod Obtain a latex balloon from the balloon drawer (under the arc melter) - check the balloon for holes or damage. For intermediate synthesis steps where the powder is to be re-ground at a later step, use the large balloons. For preparation of rods for the four-mirror optical floating zone furnace, use the medium (6 mm diameter) balloons. For preparation of rods for the laser floating zone furnaces, use the small (4 mm diameter) balloons. Clean the outside of the balloon using water and a kimwipe - try to get rid of any white powder left on the latex. Dust off the balloon using house nitrogen in the fume hood - try to get rid of remaining dust and kimwipe fibers. Warning The outside surface of the balloon will be the surface in contact with the powder. Strive to keep this surface free from contamination. Take a Q-tip and snap off the tip with the cotton swab. Take the remaining wooden stick and use some sandpaper to round down both ends. Sandpaper can be found in the small drawers to the left of the diamond saw. Dust off any remaining wood fibers or dust from the wooden stick using the house nitrogen in the fume hood. Push the wooden stick into the closed end of the balloon, turning it inside out. Slowly continue pulling the stick through the balloon. Avoid cross-contaminating the clean outer surface with the white powder that coats the inner surface of the latex. Perform small movements as to avoid the balloon bunching up on itself. Shake the balloon to take out the wooden stick. Use a Q-tip and some IPA/EtOH to clean the inner lip of the balloon. Secure a funnel on the end of the balloon. Each material typically warrants its own, clean funnel to minimize cross-contamination. Pour some powder into the funnel - shake, tap, and massage until it reaches to the bottom of the balloon. Densify the powder at the bottom of the balloon by pinching and pulling towards the end of the balloon. Gently roll flat with a ruler (or other flat surface) to try to achieve a cylindrical shape. CHECK OFTEN As you're packing and rolling, check that the shape is cylindrical, with minimal thick bulges and thin necks. It is easier to correct mistakes as soon as they happen - once you have moved further, it will be near impossible to correct a mistake that happened earlier. Packing in gradual amounts should help with this. Once the cylinder seems satisfactory, roll flat one last time using the ruler and ensure that the rod is straight. Take the balloon off the funnel and rub the \"empty\" part of the balloon between your fingers to try to knock down any remaining powder stuck to the walls. Tie one knot in the balloon close to the end of the sample (within 2 cm is fine). Gently pinch to keep air pockets out of the sealed portion. Tie a second knot above the first knot - position is less critical here. Cut the excess balloon just above the second knot - this helps avoid contaminating other processes with the excess powder stuck to the interior walls of the excess latex. Pressing the rod using the Cold Isostatic Press (CIP) If pressing a floating zone rod (medium or small balloons), obtain a plastic straw of the same diameter. Medium balloons match the blue spatula-straws, and small balloons match the regular clear soda straws. Cut the straw to the same length as the rod, and slice the straw open lengthwise into two long halves. Place the rod into the straw and wrap both ends using pieces of tape. Leave a \"tab\" to facilitate removing the tape later. Tape this contraption onto the interior wall of the metal cylinder sample holder that belongs to the CIP. Unscrew the CIP plug. Ensure there is enough antifreeze (green fluid) inside the chamber, and leave the CIP valve fully open. Lower the metal cylinder into the chamber with long forceps, and release. Before replacing the plug, check that the O-ring is intact and sandwiched between the two copper backing rings. Screw the plug all the way in, at which point the end of the threads should be aligned with the \"arrow\" symbol inscribed in the top of the chamber. Unscrew the plug a quarter turn (90 \\(^{\\circ}\\) ) to reduce wear on the threads. Fully open the house air supply on the right side of the fume hood, and flip the green \"on\" knob on the front face of the CIP. Note Turning the \"on\" knob opens a valve that allows the house air to drive the liquid pump - it will be loud when it turns on! Check the sight glass on the top face of the CIP to verify that fluid is indeed being circulated. You should see a small bubble that is \"pulsing\" with each stroke of the pump. Tighten the CIP valve, being careful not to overtighten. As soon as it is tight enough, pressure will start to build. Once it reaches the desired pressure (max. pressure 47,500 psi), flip the green power knob to the \"off\" position. At this point, pressure should hold - if it doesn't gently tighten the CIP valve. You can turn off the air supply at this point. Wait the desired amount of hold time. For most samples, you can wait as little as 30 seconds. Gently crack open the CIP valve, allowing the pressure to drop smoothly down to zero. Once it is at zero, fully open the CIP valve. Use two metal rods to unscrew the CIP plug. Use long forceps to remove the metal cylinder from inside the CIP chamber. Be careful not to avoid rough motions and bumps as to avoid breaking the newly pressed rod. Bring the metal cylinder to the sink and rinse excess antifreeze off with tap water. Replace the CIP plug - no need to screw it on all the way, as long as objects can't fall into the chamber. Remove sample from cylinder, and wash off excess antifreeze with IPA/EtOH. Extracting the rod Note For large and medium balloons, you can get away with using a razor blade to slice open the length of the balloon, without using any support. The rod should be strong enough to hold itself together without cracking at these diameters. Use scissors to cut open the balloon near the sample. Obtain the \"sandbox\" extracting tool and fill groove with sand ( locally sourced ). Ensure sand bed is flat and uniform. Lay rod down into the sand bed, and ensure that sand uniformly supports the length of the rod. Obtain a piece of tape, and use de-static tool to prepare the tape before gently taping down the rod. Completely tape down the entire length of the rod. Obtain a curved razor blade and slowly cut down the length of the sample. As you go, peel the balloon left and right to release it from the rod. Once the balloon is mostly open (2 mm - 4 mm remaining), slice the tape to release the rod from the sand bed. Slowly pull the balloon off the sample, pulling as anti-parallel as possible (like peeling a banana). Tip Once pressed, the rod will not stay pressed for very long. Do not wait longer than a few hours to begin sintering the rod. If you need to store the rod in the interim for transportation, you can wrap it in a kimwipe and place it in a long centrifuge tube. Sintering the rod Several options exist for sintering floating zone rods. Box furnaces and tube furnaces : Use an alumina boat, preferably with some powder of similar composition acting as a \"powder bed\" to prevent any reaction between the alumina and your rod. In the ESB 3312 lab, the back wall of SentroTech furnaces can operate between 1100 \\(^\\circ\\) C and 1600 \\(^\\circ\\) C. The other box furnaces can operate between room temperature and approximately 1000 \\(^\\circ\\) C. Vertical Molysili Furnace : Located in the Quantum Structures Facility , specifically the crystal growth facility , the vertical furnace can be used to sinter rods at temperatures up to 1800 \\(^\\circ\\) in gas environments including flowing Ar and flowing O \\(_2\\) . For more information, see the SOP for the vertical furnace . Clean up! Wipe up any antifreeze on the countertops, it tends to never evaporate so it will stay there forever otherwise. Collect any sand and return it to the storage container. Although it can be reused for extracting samples, know that the sand is hazardous waste - it contains residual powder from many samples. Clean your funnel and keep for the next time you press the same material.","title":"Sample Preparation"},{"location":"sampleprep/#sample-preparation","text":"Sample preparation materials are located in the Wilson Lab, Engineering Science Building Room 3312.","title":"Sample preparation"},{"location":"sampleprep/#powder-synthesis","text":"Typically powders are dried for at least 6 hours before this step.
