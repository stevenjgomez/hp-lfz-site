# Welcome to the High-Pressure Laser Floating Zone Lab Documentation!

![LaserLabImage](image.png)

The high-pressure laser floating zone furnaces enable synthesis of a wide variety of volatile and metastable phases, at pressures up to 1,000 bar. For more details about the furnace capabilities, see the publications for the two iterations of the furnace, [LAPIS](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/rsi/article/90/4/043906/283212/High-pressure-laser-floating-zone-furnace) and LOKII (TBD).
