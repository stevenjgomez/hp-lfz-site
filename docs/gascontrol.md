# Pressurizing the chamber
- Prepare low pressure manifold
    - Gas bottles
    - Swagelok valves
    - Mass flow controller
    - Getter
- Prepare inlet and outlet valves
    - Ball valves
    - Needle valves
- Safety considerations
- Pressurize to bottle pressure (~1000 psi)
- Use compressor to achieve higher pressures (~15,000 psi)
    - Turning on the compressor
    - Controlling the compressor stroke rate
    - Changing the pressure limit of the compressor
- High pressure gas flow system
